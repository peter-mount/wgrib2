# wgrib2 within an Alpine Docker container

This is a multiarch docker container containing the wgrib2 utility.

# Usage

The simplest way to use this is with:

```
docker run -it --rm -u $(id -u) -v $(pwd):/opt wgrib2 {command arguments}
```

This will run wgrib2 on the current directory. Any files generated by it will have the user running the container as it's owner.

For the command arguments see: http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib2/

# Versions

Currently the following versions are supported:
* 2.0.7 Dec 29 2017 (Also tagged as latest)
* 2.0.6c Feb 17 2017
* 2.0.4 Feb 23 2016
* 2.0.3 Nov 13 2015

2.0.5 is not supported as it doesn't compile.

# Architectures

This is intended to be a multiarch image so you can simply use this container on either amd64 or arm64 based servers.

However currently only amd64 is supported until I figure out why
configure doesn't work on arm64v6
